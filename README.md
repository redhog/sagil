----------

Welcome to the Sagil 1.0 release party! Team Sagil has been working
tirelessly towards this moment for 10 years now, and we are proud to
finally announce the release of Lavinia Iselin Mithra Sagil!

The release party will take place on the weekend 2024-07-19 to
2024-07-21 at

Our release party is beta release friendly! We believe in releasing
early and testing in production! Human models are welcome from as
early releases as 0 years.
